✅ need to add more functions in visualizer to store the full solutions obtained by the algorithm, such as the final pareto solutions.
✅ need to add community concept in the whole process, such as the stratify sampling, and the fairness function design.
need to read new downloaded papers to make sure the innovation of our idea.

✅ now we have a stratifiedFMODGWO, which reduce the complexity of the original one.
✅ later i will try to add community information to reduce complexity more and improve the fairness performance.
